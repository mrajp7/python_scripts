# __name__ = __main__
# The above keyword states that the current script that being run is assigned to
# a special variable called __name__.

# this is done automatically by python.

# we would happend to see in lot of modules or files mentioning that
# if __name__ == __main__

# since python doesn't have an main function main() like other languages,
# anything on indentation is considered as statements under __main__ and will be executed. (implicit)

# so when if __name__ == main is true, the script is being run as main file
# when a else block is written for the if above, that will be executed when the file / module is imported

# example 'copy_tic_tact_toe.py'
